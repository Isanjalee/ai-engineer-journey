# Day 02 — Python Fundamentals for AI

## What I Practiced
- Python syntax (variables, strings, numbers, bools)
- Lists and loops
- Dictionaries and functions
- Conditional logic
- Input/output using file handling

## Files Created
- `day02_python_basics/practice.py`
- `day02_python_basics/io_demo.py`

## Learnings
- Practicing simple Python daily builds fluency
- File operations are useful for saving AI responses later
- Loops and functions will be key for agent workflows
- `if / elif` conditions must be ordered correctly to avoid unreachable logic

## Challenges
- Initially ran Python files from the wrong directory, which caused “file not found” errors
- Learned the importance of understanding the current working directory in the terminal
- Faced a logic issue in `if / elif` conditions where lower conditions were never reached
- Understood that conditional checks must be ordered from highest to lowest
- Fixed these issues by adjusting command paths and reordering conditions

## Next Steps
- Learn how to structure Python projects
- Begin exploring JSON and API handling tomorrow
