# AI Engineer Journey 🚀

This repository documents my **step-by-step journey to becoming an AI Engineer / Agent Developer**.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Track daily progress transparently
- Build strong fundamentals in AI, ML, and Agent-based systems
- Maintain reproducible, professional engineering practices
- Serve as a long-term portfolio of learning and projects

## 📌 About This Journey

I am starting this journey with a **strong focus on fundamentals**, real-world tooling, and disciplined documentation.

Instead of rushing into tools, this repository emphasizes:
- Clean environment setup
- Version control best practices
- Daily technical logs
- Incremental learning with hands-on work

Every day is documented so that:
- Others can follow or reproduce the same steps
- I can reflect on growth over time
- Recruiters or collaborators can understand my learning path
